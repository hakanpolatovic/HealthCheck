# HealthCheck
Healthcheck is a basic java program that asks you a few questions and after calculating them gives you an input about your health.I think it would be helpful for people 
new in java like me.I have inserted explanations to understand code easier.This code contains various things like jframe,jlabel,mouselistener etc.
